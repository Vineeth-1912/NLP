# Customer Review Analysis: A Step-by-Step Guide

This repository provides a step-by-step guide to performing customer review analysis, complete with code and explanations.  Follow along to learn how to process raw customer feedback and extract valuable insights.

## Overview

In this project, you'll learn how to analyze customer reviews to understand customer sentiment and identify key product attributes. We'll cover everything from data loading and preprocessing to sentiment scoring.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

This repository is structured as a step-by-step tutorial. Follow these steps in order to complete the analysis:

1.  **Loading the customer reviews dataset:** Learn how to load your customer review data into a suitable format for analysis.
2.  **Clean and preprocess the reviews:** Discover techniques for cleaning and preparing text data for analysis. This includes removing irrelevant characters, handling capitalization, and more.  We'll delve into the importance of clean data for accurate sentiment analysis.
3.  **Tokenize the reviews and removing the stopwords:** Understand the process of tokenization (splitting text into individual words or tokens) and stop word removal (removing common words that don't carry significant meaning).
4.  **Practice Task - Text Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Solidify your understanding with a hands-on practice task. Apply the cleaning and preprocessing techniques you've learned.
5.  **Exploring the tokens and product categories:** Learn how to explore the resulting tokens and gain insights into the different product categories present in your dataset.
6.  **Extracting the adjectives in the reviews:** Focus on extracting adjectives, as they often carry strong sentiment.  We'll explore methods for identifying and isolating adjectives within the reviews.
7.  **Finding the sentiment of each review:** Implement sentiment analysis techniques to determine the overall sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in each review [1].
8.  **Challenge Task - Customer Review Analysis:** Put your skills to the test with a comprehensive challenge task that combines all the steps you've learned.

## Learning Approach

This guide utilizes a split-screen video approach. You'll watch an instructor walk through each step in a video on one side of the screen, while you implement the code and techniques in your own work area on the other side.

## Technologies Used

*   Python
*   NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) [8]
*   \[Possibly others, list libraries like scikit-learn, Pandas, etc. as appropriate based on your actual code [4]]

## Potential Applications

*   Identify areas for product improvement
*   Monitor customer satisfaction
*   Gain insights into product perception
*   Improve product recommendations [7]
*   Analyze market trends [2]

## Datasets

*   \[Information about the dataset(s) you are using.  If you are using a publicly available dataset, provide a link and description. If you are using your own dataset, describe its format and structure.]
